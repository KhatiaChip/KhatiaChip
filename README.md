ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! 

-I'm Khatia, a responsible, ambitious, and creative Front-End developer and UI/UX designer. I thrive on creating user-friendly interfaces and am always eager to explore new technologies. As a proactive teammate, I'm open-minded and value collaboration. Beyond coding, I'm passionate about creating new user-friendly designs. My secondary skill is UI/UX design, which is both my second job and hobby. My UI/UX design skill complements my coding skills, as they work together. In my opinion, a UI/UX designer should also know how to code, right? I hope you will enjoy my work. You can also find my Behance link to check out my UI/UX design portfolio.
